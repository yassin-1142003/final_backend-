# API Updates Summary

## Recent Implementations

### 1. Comment Reporting System

We have successfully implemented a complete comment reporting system for the Real Estate API. This allows users to report inappropriate comments, and administrators to manage these reports. Here's a summary of the changes made:

- **CommentReport Model**: Created a new model with relationships to both the `Comment` and `User` models.
- **SoftDeletes**: Added soft delete capability to both `Comment` and `CommentReport` models.
- **Controllers**: Updated CommentController and created CommentReportController
- **Routes**: Added new endpoints for reporting and resolving comments
- **Middleware**: Created AdminMiddleware for role-based access control

### 2. Saved Searches System

We have also implemented a saved searches system that allows users to save their property search criteria for future use. Key components include:

- **SavedSearch Model**: Created a model with JSON storage for search filters
- **Controller Methods**: Implemented CRUD operations for saved searches
- **Notification Support**: Added fields for notification preferences and frequency
- **Routes**: Added endpoints for managing saved searches
- **Postman Collection**: Updated with requests for testing saved searches
